# Bootleg Touhou

This fan-made rendition of the original Project Touhou series contains 3 levels of difficulty with several unique bosses and about 4–6 minutes of gameplay per level.

Your goal is to survive until the end while also shooting enemies, as the more you kill, the more powerful you become.
